## Temperature at height:
**t2m:** Temperature at 2 meters above the ground.

## Pressure:
**sp:** Surface pressure.  
**msl:** Mean sea level pressure.

## Water Vapor:
**tcwv:** Total column water vapor (amount of water vapor in a column of atmosphere from the surface to the top of the atmosphere).

## Pressure Levels:
For the following variables, the numbers (50, 100, 150, etc.) indicate the pressure level in hectopascals (hPa), with lower numbers corresponding to higher altitudes in the atmosphere:

## Wind Speed Components:
**u:** Wind speed in the east-west direction.  
**v:** Wind speed in the north-south direction.

## Geopotential Height (z):
The height above sea level at a given pressure level.

## Temperature at pressure(t):
The temperature at a specific pressure level.

## Relative Humidity (r):
The relative humidity at a specific pressure level.

## Specific Humidity (q):
The specific humidity at a specific pressure level (the mass of water vapor per unit mass of air).

## Examples:
**u50:** Wind speed in the east-west direction at 50 hPa.  
**v500:** Wind speed in the north-south direction at 500 hPa.  
**z1000:** Geopotential height at 1000 hPa.  
**t700:** Temperature at 700 hPa.  
**r850:** Relative humidity at 850 hPa.  
**q925:** Specific humidity at 925 hPa.
